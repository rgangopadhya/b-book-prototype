# Bottomless Book Overview

Bottomless Book is a tablet app designed for young children (tested with as young as 1 and as old as 5) and their parents to create their own stories. Children pick from a set of characters and 5 scenes with that character are provided. They then record their story, and can play it back later.

The app itself is fairly simple, with just a handful of screens:

1. Registration
2. Profile
3. Landing (if logged in)
4. Create a new story
5. Listen to past stories

## Vision

Right now, Bottomless Book has 3 characters, with 5 scenes for each character. Eventually there will be more characters, with more scenes for each character. We intend to make it easy for artists to add new characters to the system.

Technically, the app should be saving data locally by default, with a cloud sync on-demand. This would improve performance. An immediate next step is to store the character and story data locally.
